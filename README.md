Title: Adaptive Bregman primal-dual algorithms for general bilinear min-max problems with applications to imaging

This paper proposes a Bregman primal-dual algorithm with convex combination and adaptive step sizes for solving general min-max problem. The proposed adaptive strategy has the advantage of updating only one variable per linesearch iteration and not requiring additional gradient evaluations, which is computationally cheaper for many practical problems.

Numerical experiments on the color transfer and PET image reconstruction problems demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithms.
